# Pewlett Hackard "Silver Tsunami" Analysis

## Overview:
We will help Pewlett Hackard evaluate their current employee population to prepare for a possible wave of upcoming retirements. We will use SQL to analyze employee information stored in six CSV files.

## Results:
* Using SQL we were able to organize and filter employee information stored in multiple CSV files to show the distribution of titles of current employees between the age of 67 and 70. We can thus conclude that about 70,000 current employees could be retiring in the next few years.

* The detailed employee information for the above table is stored in the
[unique_titles.csv](Data/unique_titles.csv) file.

* Pewleet Hackard plans to set up a mentorship program to promote the "next generation" talents to fill vacancies from upcoming wave of retirements. We are tasked to identified current employees who are about 57 years old that maybe able to be mentors for this program.  We identified about 1,500 employees and stored their information in the [mentorship_eligibilty.csv](Data/unique_titles.csv) file.

* From our analysis, we believe 1,500 mentors may not be enough to generate enough candidates to fullfill possible vacacies leave behind from the upcoming 70,000+ retiring employees.


## Summary:
To better manage the 70,000 possible vacancies of positions from the upcoming "Silver Tsuami", we recommend Pewleet Hackard expand their mentorship program to include employees with birthdates between 1962 to 1967. We identified these employees with their information in the [expand_mentorship.csv](Data/expand_mentorship.csv) file.  In this expanded program, we will have about 57,000 possible mentors. We believe this mentorship program should be able to promote talents within to fill the upcoming vacancies.  Below table show the distribution of title for these mentors.
